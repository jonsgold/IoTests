IoTests is a benchmark testing suite for Java IO.

How to run
----------

	1. cd IoTests
	2. java -cp target/classes:target/test-classes test.performance.BenchmarkTest [SINGLE|MULTI|NIO]

My results
----------

- HW - I ran the tests on a Sun machine:

	1. Memory: 4GB
	2. Processor: Dual-Core AMD Opteron 1214x2
	3. OS: ubuntu 12.04 64-bit

- JVM - The JVM was run with the following options:

	java -Xmx2048m -cp target/classes:target/test-classes test.performance.BenchmarkTest [SINGLE|MULTI|NIO]

- Results for src/main/resources/test-file-5M.txt (5 million lines) -

		# Lines -->	-	2M	1.5M	1M	500K	100K	10K
	SINGLE			39.6	x	x	x	x	x	x
	NIO (8192 buffer)	36.7	x	x	x	x	x	x
	MULTI			x	112.8	105	81.6	71.3	41.5	32.7

Use of the package java.nio doesn't make much of an improvement over java.io, since character reading is being tested. However, the multi-threaded class (with chunks of 10K lines) proves that when heavy processing is involved, multiple worker threads does speed up the performance.
